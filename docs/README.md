This is the on-line edition of the ObjectStructures book by Jacob Gore.
Currently it is only a markdown version of the original text with diagrams in [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com).
But, we (Jacob Gore and [Alejandro Garcia](https://elviejo79.github.io)  are working towards a second edition,
with interactive examples and algorithm animations.
